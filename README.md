# BCF Report Printer
=========
An application to convert BCF report files into Workd documents

This is a fork of the [BCFReader application](https://www.bim42.com/2015/01/bfc-reader/) by Simon Moreau


#Walkthrough
=========

###Load your BCF file

Click on the ... button and select a BCF 1.0 file.

###Load your template

In order to have a nicely formated template for your report, you have to load a Word Document Template. You can add anything in this template, like a front page, or a header. You can also specify paragraph styles you will use in your report. To do so, write a few lines in your template, apply desired styles, then delete them. This will insure than the paragraph styles are properly loaded in the template before you use it.
Once your *.dot file is properly set up, click on the ... button and load it.

###Select your styles

Once the template is loaded, the BCF Reader will propose you to assign a style to a specific part of your report.

###Save your report

After selecting styles, you can save your report as a *.docx file.
